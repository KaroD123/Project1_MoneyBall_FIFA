Objectiv
Performing an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what I have learned so far. I applied statistical and machine learning techniques.

Subobjectivs:
1. Order players by Overall Rating (OVA).
2. Which country has in average the best players (by OVA)?
3. Are the best 10 players by OVA more or less agressive than the average?
4. Where are most of the players from?
